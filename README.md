Stage 2: Execute external commands —- 10 marks
In Unix-type systems, the fork() function can be used to create a new process (a child
process) that is an exact duplicate of the current one. Both processes parent (original) and
child (new) will continue execution from the point immediately after the fork function
call.
In order to allow the child process to execute something different than the code of the
parent process, we need to use one of the exec() system call variants. One of the
parameters of the exec variants is the program to be executed, while another includes the
parameters with which the program will be invoked.
In the case of your shell, after fork() the parent process waits (wait() function) for
the child process to complete, and then continues its execution. See Figure 3.10 in the
textbook or the lecture slides for an example.
In Unix-type systems like Linux, when a user logs in or starts a terminal a shell is loaded.
As part of the initialization of the shell, a number of system properties are set. These
properties make up the system environment. You can see what the current environment
is by typing ‘setenv’.
For this stage we are only interested in one thing from the environment: the PATH —
the set of directories (colon separated), where the shell searches for external executable
programs.
The key point for this stage is to choose an appropriate variant of exec() that will take
into account the PATH environment parameter. Read also the manual very carefully
about how to handle external program parameters. Remember that we should be able to
support any number of command parameters.

Do not also forget to handle the situation where an invalid program was entered, in
which case you should provide the user with an appropriate error message.
Parsing simplification
In order to simplify the parsing so that built-in commands can be easily added, it is a
good idea to generate a single string array that includes all the tokens of the user input
line. This way you can parse the user input line, in the same way, all the time irrespective
of whether it contains built-in or external commands or the number of tokens it contains!
To make your life even easier you can use a fixed size array, thus putting a limit on the
number of tokens accepted. Fifty tokens will be a reasonable number here
Stage 2: Testing
First, test that the code you have added to your shell has not broken the previously
working code (i.e. repeat the same tests that you carried out for stage 1). They should still
work. In software engineering, this is referred to as regression testing.
To test that the new functionality in your shell works you should invoke a number of
programs (system or otherwise) and see them execute.
In order to check that you are handling correctly any number of parameters a very good
system program to use is ‘ls’ which provides a list of the contents of a directory. The
good thing about it is that it takes a number of flags that change the formatting of the
output and it can also take a list of directory/files (of any length) and list their contents
or them.
You can check whether your program correctly handles paths (i.e. only looks for executa-
bles in the directories specified by the path) by invoking your shell from within your
shell! Typically the current directory (i.e. ‘.’) is in the path so you should be able to do
this if you are running your shell from the directory the executable resides in, but not
from another directory (e.g. MyShell/shell and then type ‘shell’ at the prompt).
Do not forget to check what happens when an invalid program is provided by the user
